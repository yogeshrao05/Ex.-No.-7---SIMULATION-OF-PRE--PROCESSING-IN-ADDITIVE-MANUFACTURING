# Ex. No. 7 - SIMULATION OF PRE PROCESSING IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING

## AIM:
### To simulate the Pre Processing for 3D printing.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### Pre-processing encompasses the steps between design and printing. Process of 3D printing starts with designing in CAD. Then printer software slices 3D CAD file into layers. For each slice, the software converts the data into machine code that determines tool paths for the machine to follow. The various steps in pre-processing from design to printing are as follows:

### 1)	CAD File
### 2)	Conversion to STL a. Orientation b. Support Structure c. Slicing d. Path Planning

### 1. CAD File
### Every manufacturing process starts with the process of designing and as in any type of manufacturing, there are certain limitations to the materials and manufacturing processes that dictate how the product should be designed, 3D printing is no different. In 3d printing, characteristics of hardware, software, temperature, filament and many other factors play an important role in how a digital model translates into a printed object. Some of them are designed with a strong base, grain direction, overhung, wall thickness, round corners and tolerances.

### 2. Conversion to STL
### In order to check the interface of the object and make it reliable to 3d printers, conversion to STL file is required. It also facilitates other features like quick error check, bridging the gap between CAD platforms, exhibition purposes and 3D digitizer extension.

### a. Orientation:
### Orientation plays a vital role in the final product of 3d printing as it affects the part accuracy, manufacturing time, strength and surface finish. There are various orientations by which we can print the object such as vertically upward, vertically downward and in horizontal plane.

### b. Support Structure:
### Support structures are required where the objects are unable to get printed directly. Support structures help to guarantee the printability of a section during the 3D printing measure and also it can assist with forestalling part twisting, secure a section to the printing bed and guarantee that parts are joined to the fundamental body of the printed part.

### c. Slicing:
### The motive behind slicing a 3D model is to transform the model into guidelines for the 3D printer. To play out this errand, the slicing software isolates the item into numerous layers. It's classified "slicing" since it "slices" the 3D model to make numerous layers. After the layers have been made, the slicing software applies different qualities to every one of them.

### d. Path Planning:
### Path planning helps to improve the printed surface quality, shape accuracy and infill distribution quality. There are various ways for path planning which can be used to print the objects which may affect the following factors in objects like raster path, grid path, spiral path and zigzag path.

Preparing a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) file for 3D printing involves several important steps to ensure optimal printability and desired outcomes. Here's a detailed guide on how to prepare a CAD file for 3D printing:
The important to note that the base material thickness also depends on the design and geometry of the object being printed. Complex geometries or overhangs may require support structures, which can add additional material and affect the overall thickness.
Ultimately, the appropriate base material thickness is determined by balancing the

In additive manufacturing, the STL (Standard Tessellation Language) file format is commonly used for 3D models. Converting a 3D model to an STL file involves a process called triangulation, which converts the model's geometry into a mesh of interconnected triangles.

 Adjust the scale and orientation of the model to match the desired size and fit within the print volume of the 3D printer. Consider the resolution and capabilities of the printer while determining the appropriate scaling factor. Orient the model to optimize printing, minimizing the need for supports or ensuring proper layer adhesion.

 Determine if support structures are required to ensure successful printing. Some CAD software provides tools to manually add support structures, or you can rely on automatic support generation in the slicing software.3D printing support materials enable you to create and print complex geometries, parts with internal features, and parts that cannot be manufactured by any other method. Without support, your build material would deform before it hardened.

: Import the CAD file into slicing software. Configure the slicing parameters, including layer height, print speed, infill density, support settings, and any other relevant parameters. Preview the sliced model in the software to identify any potential issues and make necessary adjustments.

Path planning in 3D printing refers to the process of determining the optimal toolpath or trajectory that the 3D printer's nozzle or extruder will follow to create the desired object. This path planning is typically performed by the slicing software as part of the overall preparation process. Here are some key aspects of path planning in 3D printing:
